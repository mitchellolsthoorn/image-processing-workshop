    "# Image Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Image filtering is a technique used to process and manipulate images by applying a mathematical operation to the pixel values. The goal is to enhance certain features or reduce unwanted elements, such as noise, in an image. Filters can either sharpen, blur, detect edges, or transform the image in various ways, depending on the filter used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of image filtering, a kernel (also called a filter or convolution matrix) is a small matrix used to apply effects like blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more to an image. The kernel is usually much smaller than the image itself (often 3x3, 5x5, or similar), and it is applied to every pixel in the image to compute a new pixel value based on the surrounding ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kernel Matrix: The kernel is a matrix of numbers that defines the transformation to apply. Each number in the kernel represents how much the surrounding pixels contribute to the final value of the current pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convolution Operation: The kernel moves (slides) across the image pixel by pixel, and at each position, it multiplies the values in the kernel by the corresponding pixel values in the image (element-wise multiplication). The results are then summed up, and the central pixel is replaced with the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Effect of Kernel Size and Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blurring: A kernel with equal values (like 1/9 for a 3x3 kernel) will average out pixel values, creating a blur effect.\n",
    "- Edge Detection: A kernel like [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 8, -1], [-1, -1, -1]] emphasizes differences between adjacent pixels, detecting edges.\n",
    "- Sharpening: Kernels with a higher central value and negative surrounding values enhance contrast around edges, sharpening the image."

Its primary purpose is to smooth an image by reducing noise and minor details, which is achieved by replacing each pixel's value with the average of its neighboring pixel values.
